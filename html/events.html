            <p>The CAT Coding Trial is a month long challenges with no awards, and no grades; a group activity that promotes co-operation, and has no time pressure.</p>
            <p>You can code in any of the many different languages that they support, and fix code that has been flagged as incorrect until the end of the event!</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.7rem;">Note that this was a trial, as such, there is no longer an applicable webpage for it in 2025, so this links to the short test run by AMT instead.</p>
